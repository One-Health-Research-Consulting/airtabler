\usage{
process_table_for_excel(df, preserve_ids = TRUE, clean_attachment_cols = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame. The table from air_dump() to process}

\item{preserve_ids}{Logical. If TRUE (default), keeps ID columns which are necessary for maintaining
relationships between tables. Set to FALSE if you want to create fresh records without preserving links.}

\item{clean_attachment_cols}{Logical. If TRUE (default), converts attachment columns
to a format that Airtable can understand during import. Attachments will be represented
by their IDs as comma-separated strings.}
}
\value{

}
\description{
Helper function to prepare a dataframe for Excel export in a way that's compatible with Airtable import.
Converts list columns to character strings, handles attachments, and optionally preserves ID columns
to maintain relationships between tables.
}
\details{
This function handles several types of Airtable data:
- List columns (such as linked records, attachments, and multi-select fields) are converted to comma-separated strings
- Attachment columns are specially processed to extract IDs
- NULL values are converted to empty strings
